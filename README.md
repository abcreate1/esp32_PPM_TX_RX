# esp32_PPM_TX_RX
ESP32-Based 6-Channel PPM Transmitter & Receiver for Drones
This project implements a lightweight 6-channel PPM (Pulse Position Modulation) radio control system for drones using ESP32 microcontrollers and the ESP-NOW protocol.

# Key Features
✅ ESP32-based wireless RC system (no need for traditional transmitter modules)

✅ 6-channel PPM output for drone flight controllers

✅ Uses ESP-NOW protocol for low-latency communication

✅ Compact and customizable design

✅ Open-source firmware for both transmitter and receiver

# Applications
DIY drone projects

RC aircraft systems

Robotics control

Custom wireless control systems

# Hardware Components
ESP32 development boards (for both transmitter and receiver)

Potentiometers/Joyticks for transmitter input

Optional: PWM-to-PPM converter if your flight controller requires it

# Advantages over Traditional Systems
Lower cost compared to commercial systems

Programmable and customizable

No need for RF modules (uses ESP32's built-in wireless)

Supports bidirectional data (telemetry potential)
